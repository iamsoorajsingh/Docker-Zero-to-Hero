# Docker Daemon

**The Docker daemon (dockerd) is the heart of the Docker platform, responsible for managing and running containerized applications.
In the context of Docker, the Docker daemon (commonly referred to as dockerd) is a background process that acts as the engine for managing and running containerized applications. It's an essential component of the Docker ecosystem, responsible for various crucial tasks:**

**Key Roles:**

- **Image Management:**
    - Downloads, stores, and builds Docker images.
- **Container Lifecycle:**
    - Creates, starts, stops, restarts, and removes containers.
- **Resource Allocation:**
    - Allocates CPU, memory, network, and other resources to containers.
- **Network Management:**
    - Sets up and manages container networks.
- **Storage Management:**
    - Handles storage volumes for persistent data.
- **Security:**
    - Enforces security policies and isolation between containers.
- **API Interface:**
    - Provides an API for external tools and applications to interact with Docker objects.

**Key Points:**

- Runs as a background process (service) on Linux and macOS, part of Docker Desktop on Windows.
- Users interact with Docker through the client (`docker`), which communicates with the daemon.
- Configuration options can be adjusted through a JSON configuration file.
